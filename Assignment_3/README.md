The goal is to identify **frequent words in text files (books)** using different methods, and to **evaluate the quality of estimates** regarding the **exact counts**.

To accomplish that, develop and test three different approaches:
- **exact counters**,
- **approximate counters**,
- one algorithm to identify **frequent items in data streams**.
